# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock-game

This is a game played mostly by computer geeks or nerds.The idea of the game is simple: it is played with a hand and there are different representation of rock paper scissors lizard spock with the hand. see picture below:


it takes two players with each one having the opportunity to display one of the hand representation of  rock, paper, scissors, lizard and spock. These are the rules:

Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.

Depending on what representation you made, there is a winner. There will only be a tie when both players choose the same representation.
This python game of rpsl is played with a player vs computer. The computer chooses randomly amongst rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock whiles the player has the opportunity to enter what He chooses to in the function call.
